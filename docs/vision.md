# FluentOS Vision

## What is FluentOS?

FluentOS is a **UX layer for Windows 11** that brings coherence, readability, and productivity to the desktop experience.

### What it IS

- A collection of **curated UX presets** and configurations
- A **PowerShell-based installation** framework for reproducible setups
- An **integration layer** for community tools (Seelen, Windhawk, DWMBlurGlass, Explorer tweaks)
- A **policy and guideline** document for consistent styling and behavior
- A **POC** (v0.1) leading toward v1.0 Core Platform

### What it is NOT

- A **custom Windows ISO** or operating system fork
- A **kernel patcher** or low-level modification tool
- A **license bypass** or security circumvention mechanism
- A **replacement shell** – it enhances the existing Windows 11 shell

## Core Pillars

### 1. Coherence
A unified visual language across all UI elements, from desktop to taskbar to window decorations.

### 2. Readability
Clear typography, adequate spacing, and accessible color schemes that reduce cognitive load.

### 3. Productivity
Thoughtful UX patterns that minimize friction and accelerate common workflows.

### 4. Governance
Clear documentation, reversible changes, and a modular structure that scales from personal to fleet-wide deployments.

## Target Audience

- **Core**: Power users and enthusiasts seeking a polished Windows 11 experience
